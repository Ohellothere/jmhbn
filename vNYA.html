  <p>Now and then I think of when we were together <br>
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die <br>
Told myself that you were right for me <br>
But felt so lonely in your company<br>
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember<br><br>
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness<br>
Like resignation to the end, always the end<br>
So when we found that we could not make sense<br>
Well, you said that we would still be friends<br>
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over<br><br>
But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
And I don't even need your love<br>
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br><br>
No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
Have your friends collect your records<br>
And then change your number<br>
I guess that I don't need that though<br>
Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br><br>
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over<br>
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done<br>
But I don't wanna live that way<br>
Reading into every word you say<br>
You said that you could let it go<br>
And I wouldn't catch, you hung up on
Somebody that you used to know<br><br>
But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
And I don't even need your love<br>
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br><br>
And you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
Have your friends collect your records<br>
And then change your number<br>
I guess that I don't need that though<br>
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)<br>
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)<br>
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody</p>
